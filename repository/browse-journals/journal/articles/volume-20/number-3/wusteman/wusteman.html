          <p>
            Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are schemas that describe the
            structure and, to a limited extent, the content of Extensible Markup
            Language (XML) and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
            documents <a href="#brown">(Brown, 2002)</a>. At its inception, the
            XML standard inherited the DTD from SGML as its only schema
            language. Many alternative schema languages have subsequently been
            developed for XML. But the DTD is still alive and actively used to
            define narrative-based document types. This article describes the
            basic syntax of the DTD and compares it to its two main rivals: W3C
            XML Schema and RELAX NG.

          <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Despite their names, Extensible Markup Language (XML) and its
            predecessor, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), are not
            languages per se. Rather, they are systems for creating customised
            markup languages. The languages created by XML and SGML are referred
            to as XML and SGML applications, respectively. The sets of rules
            that define XML and SGML applications are called schemas. Schemas
            describe the structure and, to a varying extent, the content and
            semantics of documents that conform to specific applications. For
            example, a schema for XHTML 1.0 Strict would, among other things,
            identify and define the relationships between the elements and
            attributes allowed or required in an XHTML 1.0 Strict document. The
            schema language designed for use by SGML applications was the
            Document Type Definition (DTD). At its inception, the XML standard
            inherited the DTD as its only schema language. However, many
            alternative schema languages have subsequently been developed for
            XML. The most influential of these are the W3C XML Schema language
            <sup><a href="#scema">1</a></sup> and the RELAX NG schema Language
            <sup><a href="#relax">2</a></sup
            >. But, despite its rivals, and continuous predictions of its
            demise, the DTD is still alive and actively used to define
            narrative-based document types such as e-journal articles, prose,
            poetry and, for the time-being, archival finding aids.

          <h3 id="xml_instances">XML Instances</h3>
          <p>
            XML documents are commonly referred to as XML instances. The
            software that reads and interprets these instances is called an XML
            parser. The parser may be contained within another piece of
            software, such as a browser or an editor, or it may exist
            independently. Parsers come in two main varieties: non-validating
            and validating. Non-validating parsers simply check whether XML
            instances are well-formed, i.e., whether they obey basic constraints
            such as including a root element that contains all other elements.
            Validating parsers also check whether instances are valid, i.e.,
            whether they conform to the rules of a schema, e.g., a DTD.

          <p>
            <!--&lt; and &gt; seen below to prevent bogus element error in validator-->
            Figure 1 illustrates an example of a well-formed XML instance,
            prefaced by the relevant DTD (within the square brackets). This
            simple DTD comprises a series of element and attribute declarations.
            The first thing to notice is that a DTD is not written using XML
            document syntax; rather, it uses a distinctive syntax of its own.
            The basic structure of an element declaration is as follows:
            &lt;!ELEMENT elementName (content-model)&gt; Note that reserved
            words, such as ELEMENT, must appear in upper case. The right-hand
            side of the element declaration, referred to as the content model,
            details what combinations of child elements and plain text
            (indicated by #PCDATA) are permitted to appear in the element in
            question and in what order they may appear.

          </figure>
          <p>
            The occurrence indicators +, ? and *, listed in Table 1, define how
            many times an element (or a more complex pattern within parentheses)
            can be repeated. For example,an entry may include * One optional
            publisher * At least one isbn, but it can have any number. * Any
            number of notes or none at all.

          <p>
            The validation of XML documents is too diverse to rely on a single
            schema language across all domains
            <a href="#goldberg">(Goldberg, 2009)</a>. It is likely that the
            medium term future will see the use of a range of schema languages,
            particularly XML Schema, RELAX NG, DTDs and, to a lesser extent,
            Schematron <sup><a href="#stron">3</a></sup
            >. This is being encouraged by the development of the ISO Document
            Schema Definition Languages (DSDL) standard
            <sup><a href="#dsdl">4</a></sup> which aims to standardize a set of
            schema languages and define a framework for their use.

          </figure>
          <p>
            One part of the DSDL standard is a new generation of namespace and
            data type-aware DTDs. However, this is still at an early stage.
            Increasingly, applications do not rely on one document model to
            provide all the information necessary for validation
            <sup><a href="#xmlfaq">5</a></sup
            ><sup> <a href="#xml1">6</a></sup
            >. For example, DTDs may provide the tag set but additional rules
            about how these tags may be used is enforced via another schema
            language, such as Schematron, or via a traditional programming
            language such as Perl, JavaScript, XSLT, Python, Java, C#, C++,or
            Ruby. Table 2 lists some sample XML applications along with their
            normative, or definitive, schema form and any other schemas
            available.
